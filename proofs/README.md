# proofs

These texts are proofs that I created for evaluating typefaces in development. As an alternative to full-alphabet pangram sentences, such as “the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog,” these proofs offer a more scientific context for every letter, making it easier to isolate and diagnose problems with a letterform’s shape, color, or fit. You’ll find more information about these proofs, along with instructions how to use them, here:
